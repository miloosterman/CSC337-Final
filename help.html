        <h2>Snake</h2>
        <p> In the game of Snake, the player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a
            bordered plane, picking up food (or some other item), trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the "walls"
            that
            surround the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game
            increasingly difficult. The goal is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the
            snake's own growing body. The game ends when the snake hits either the wall or its own tail.</p>
        <h2>Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
        <p>Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple two-player game, played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their marks (one
            player
            uses 'X' and the other uses 'O') in an empty square. The first player to place three of their marks in a
            horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all nine squares are filled and no player has three
            marks in a row, the game is a draw. This game is known for often ending in a draw, especially as players
            become
            more experienced.</p>
        <h2>Checkers</h2>
        <p>
            Checkers is a two-player game played on an 8x8 board with 12 pieces per player. The board consists of 64
            squares, alternating between dark and light colors. Each player starts with their pieces on the three rows
            closest to them, placed only on the dark squares. Players move their pieces diagonally forward to an
            adjacent
            unoccupied square. If an opponentâ€™s piece can be "captured" by jumping over it to an empty square
            immediately
            beyond, the jump must be made. If a piece reaches the farthest row from the player, it becomes a "King,"
            which
            can move both forward and backward. The game ends when one player captures all of the opponent's pieces or
            blocks all possible moves.
